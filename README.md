# Imperial-Metric
Imperial Metric

1.I have created a Rates Repository.This will be used to fetch rates from SQL DB
2.In the API controller there are 2 web api methods to GetMetric and GetImperial units.
3.To connect to DB I have used Dapper from nuget package
4.To input and  display results I have used Swashbuckle from nuget package for getting details in Swagger UI
